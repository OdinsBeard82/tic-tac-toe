## Project Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a web-based application where players can play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does. The application provides an interactive and real-time visual representation of the game board.
